///          return state.copy(todoList: reloadedTodoList);
///       }
///    }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The problem with the above code is that it make take a second to update the
/// todoList in the screen, while we save then load, which is not a good user
/// experience.
///
/// The solution is optimistically updating the TodoList before saving the new
/// Todo to the cloud:
///
/// ```dart
/// class SaveTodo extends ReduxAction<AppState> {
///    final Todo newTodo;
///    SaveTodo(this.newTodo);
///
///    Future<AppState> reduce() async {
///
///       // Updates the TodoList optimistically.
///       dispatch(UpdateStateAction((state) => state.copy(todoList: state.todoList.add(newTodo))));
///
///       try {
///          // Saves the new Todo to the cloud.
///          await saveTodo(newTodo);
///       }
///       finally {
///          // Loads the complete TodoList from the cloud.
///          var reloadedTodoList = await loadTodoList();
///          return state.copy(todoList: reloadedTodoList);
///       }
///    }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// That's better. But if the saving fails, the users still have to wait for
/// the reload until they see the reverted state. We can further improve this:
///
/// ```dart
/// class SaveTodo extends ReduxAction<AppState> {
///    final Todo newTodo;
///    SaveTodo(this.newTodo);
///
///    Future<AppState> reduce() async {
///
///       // Updates the TodoList optimistically.
///       var newTodoList = state.todoList.add(newTodo);
///       dispatch(UpdateStateAction((state) => state.copy(todoList: newTodoList)));
///
///       try {
///          // Saves the new Todo to the cloud.
///          await saveTodo(newTodo);
///       }
///       catch (e) {
///          // If the state still contains our optimistic update, we rollback.
///          // If the state now contains something else, we DO NOT rollback.
///          if (state.todoList == newTodoList) {
///             return state.copy(todoList: initialState.todoList); // Rollback.
///          }

///          dispatch(UpdateStateAction((state) => state.copy(todoList: reloadedTodoList)));

///
/// If you use the action to load information, the throttle period may be
/// considered as the time the loaded information is "fresh". After the
/// throttle period, the information is considered "stale" and the action will
/// be allowed to load the information again.
///
/// For example, if you are using a `StatefulWidget` that needs to load some
/// information, you can dispatch the loading action when widget is created,
/// and specify a throttle period so that it doesn't load the information again
/// too often.
///
/// If you are using a `StoreConnector`, you can use the `onInit` parameter:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyScreenConnector extends StatelessWidget {
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) => StoreConnector<AppState, _Vm>(
///     vm: () => _Factory(),
///     onInit: _onInit, // Here!

///       ),
///     );
///
///   void _onInit(Store<AppState> store) {
///     store.dispatch(LoadAction());
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// and then:
///
/// ```dart
/// class LoadAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///
///   int throttle = 5000;
///
///   Future<AppState?> reduce() async {
///     var information = await loadInformation();
///     return state.copy(information: information);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The [throttle] value is given in milliseconds, and the default is 1000
/// milliseconds (1 second). You can override this default:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    int throttle = 500; // Here!
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can also override [ignoreThrottle] if you want the action to ignore the
/// throttle period under some conditions. For example, suppose you want the
/// action to provide a flag called `force` that will ignore the throttle
/// period:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    final bool force;
///    MyAction({this.force = false});
///
///    bool ignoreThrottle => force; // Here!
///
///    int throttle = 500;
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # If the action fails
///
/// The throttle period is NOT reset if the action fails. This means that if
/// the action fails, it will not run a second time if you dispatch it again
/// within the throttle period.
///
/// If you want, you can specify a different behavior by making
/// [removeLockOnError] true, like this:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    bool removeLockOnError = true; // Here!
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Now, if the action fails, it will remove the lock and allow the action to
/// be dispatched again right away. Note this currently implemented in the
/// [after] method, like this:
///
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// void after() {
///   if (removeLockOnError && (status.originalError != null)) removeLock();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can override the [after] method to customize this behavior of removing
/// the lock under some conditions.
///
/// # Advanced usage
///
/// The throttle is, by default, based on the action [runtimeType]. This means
/// it will throttle an action if another action of the same runtimeType was
/// previously dispatched within the throttle period. In other words, the
/// runtimeType is the "lock". If you want to throttle based on a different
/// lock, you can override the [lockBuilder] method. For example, here
/// we throttle two different actions based on the same lock:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction1 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
///    ...
/// }
///
/// class MyAction2 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Another example is to throttle based on some field of the action:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
///    final String lock;
///    MyAction(this.lock);
///    Object? lockBuilder() => lock;
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you override the [lockBuilder], ensure the number of different locks you
/// create is limited, as the lock map is never cleared.
///

/// - It should not be combined with other mixins that override [abortDispatch] or [after].
/// - It should not be combined with [NonReentrant] or [UnlimitedRetryCheckInternet].

/// Debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a certain period
/// of inactivity. Each time the debounced function is called, the period of
/// inactivity (or wait time) is reset.
///
/// The function will only execute after it stops being called for the duration
/// of the wait time. Debouncing is useful in situations where you want to
/// ensure that a function is not called too frequently and only runs after
/// some “quiet time.”
///
/// For example, it’s commonly used for handling input validation in text fields,
/// where you might not want to validate the input every time the user presses
/// a key, but rather after they've stopped typing for a certain amount of time.
///
///
/// The [debounce] value is given in milliseconds, and the default is 333
/// milliseconds (1/3 of a second). You can override this default:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
///    final int debounce = 1000; // Here!
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Advanced usage
///
/// The debounce is, by default, based on the action [runtimeType]. This means
/// it will reset the debounce period when another action of the same
/// runtimeType was is dispatched within the debounce period. In other words,
/// the runtimeType is the "lock". If you want to debounce based on a different
/// lock, you can override the [lockBuilder] method. For example, here
/// we debounce two different actions based on the same lock:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction1 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
///    Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
///    ...
/// }
///
/// class MyAction2 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
///    Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Another example is to debounce based on some field of the action:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
///    final String lock;
///    MyAction(this.lock);
///    Object? lockBuilder() => lock;
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Notes:
/// - It should not be combined with other mixins that override [wrapReduce].
/// - It should not be combined with [Retry] or [UnlimitedRetryCheckInternet].

  /// meaning it will debounce the dispatch of actions of the same type.
