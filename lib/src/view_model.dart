/// [Vm] is a base class for your view-models.

/// A view-model is a helper object to a [StoreConnector] widget. It holds the
/// part of the Store state the corresponding dumb-widget needs, and may also
/// convert this state part into a more convenient format for the dumb-widget
/// to work with.
///
/// Each time the state changes, all [StoreConnector]s in the widget tree will
/// create a view-model, and compare it with the view-model they created with
/// the previous state. Only if the view-model changed, the [StoreConnector]
/// will rebuild. For this to work, you must implement equals/hashcode for the
/// view-model class. Otherwise, the [StoreConnector] will think the view-model
/// changed everytime, and thus will rebuild everytime. This wouldn't create any
/// visible problems to your app, but would be inefficient and maybe slow.
///
/// Using the [Vm] class you can implement equals/hashcode without having to
/// override these methods. Instead, simply list all fields (which are not
/// immutable, like functions) to the [equals] parameter in the constructor.
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// ViewModel({this.counter, this.onIncrement}) : super(equals: [counter]);
/// ```
///
/// Each listed state will be compared by equality (==), unless it is of type
/// [VmEquals], when it will be compared by the [VmEquals.vmEquals] method,
/// which by default is a comparison by identity (but can be overridden).

  /// created factory, as it can only be called once per factory instance.
  ///
  /// The method will return the view-model, which you can use to:
  ///
  /// * Inspect the view-model properties directly, or
  ///
  /// * Call any of the view-model callbacks. If the callbacks dispatch actions,
  /// you use `await store.waitActionType(MyAction)`,

  /// var store = Store(initialState: User("Mary"));
