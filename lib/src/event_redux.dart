/// The `Event` class can be used as a Redux state with *flutter_redux* , usually to change the
/// internal state of a stateful widget. When creating the `ViewModel` with the `StoreConnector`,
/// the event is "consumed" only once, and is then automatically considered "spent".
///
/// Note that since the event is spent when consumed, it can be consumed by **one single** widget.
///
/// If the event **HAS NO VALUE AND NO GENERIC TYPE**,
/// then `Event.consume()` returns **true** if the event was dispatched,
/// or **false** otherwise.

  /// ViewModel changes. If this is not done, then every time any state in the store changes the
  /// widget will be rebuilt.
  ///
  /// And then, of course, you must implement equals and hashcode for the `ViewModel`.
  /// This can be done by typing **`ALT`+`INSERT`** in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio and
  /// choosing **`==() and hashcode`**, but you can't forget to update this whenever new
  /// parameters are added to the model.
  /// The present events must also be part of that equals/hashcode, like so:
  ///
  /// 1) If the **new** ViewModel has an event which is **not spent**, then the ViewModel
  /// **MUST** be considered distinct, no matter the state of the **old** ViewModel, since the
  /// new event should fire.
  ///
  /// 2) If both the old and new ViewModels have events which **are spent**, then these events
  /// **MUST NOT** be considered distinct, since spent events are considered "empty" and
  /// should never fire.
  ///
  /// 3) If the **new** ViewModel has an event which is **not spent**,
  /// and the **old** ViewModel has an event which **is spent**,
  /// then the new event should fire, and for that reason they **MUST** be considered distinct.
  ///
  /// 4) If the **new** ViewModel has an event which is **is spent**,
  /// and the **old** ViewModel has an event which **not spent**, then the new event
  /// should NOT fire, and for that reason they **SHOULD NOT** be considered distinct.
  ///
  /// Note: To differentiate 3 and 4 we would actually be breaking the equals contract (which says
  /// A==B should be the same as B==A). Besides, we would need to know if AsyncRedux is
  /// comparing newVm==oldViewModel or oldViewModel==newVm (and stays like this).
  /// A safer alternative is discard 4, and always consider events different if any of them is not
  /// spent. That will, however, fire some unnecessary rebuilds.
  ///
  /// In the near future, we may decide to break the equals contract (which is probably fine since
  /// the usage of [Event] is so specialized), and create unit tests to check it continues to work
  /// and detect breaks if new versions of AsyncRedux change the order of the comparison.
