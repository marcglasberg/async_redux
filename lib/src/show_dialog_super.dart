/// Displays a Material dialog above the current contents of the app, with
/// Material entrance and exit animations, modal barrier color, and modal
/// barrier behavior (dialog is dismissible with a tap on the barrier).
///
/// This function takes a [builder] which typically builds a [Dialog] widget.
/// Content below the dialog is dimmed with a [ModalBarrier]. The widget
/// returned by the [builder] does not share a context with the location that
/// [showDialogSuper] is originally called from. Use a [StatefulBuilder] or a
/// custom [StatefulWidget] if the dialog needs to update dynamically.
///
/// The [child] argument is deprecated, and should be replaced with [builder].
///
/// The [context] argument is used to look up the [Navigator] and [Theme] for
/// the dialog. It is only used when the method is called. Its corresponding
/// widget can be safely removed from the tree before the dialog is closed.
///
/// The [onDismissed] callback will be called when the dialog is dismissed.
/// Note: If the dialog is popped by `Navigator.of(context).pop(result)`,
/// then the `result` will be available to the callback. That way you can
/// differentiate between the dialog being dismissed by an Ok or a Cancel
/// button, for example.
///
/// The [barrierDismissible] argument is used to indicate whether tapping on the
/// barrier will dismiss the dialog. It is `true` by default and can not be `null`.
///
/// The [barrierColor] argument is used to specify the color of the modal
/// barrier that darkens everything below the dialog. If `null` the default color
/// `Colors.black54` is used.
///
/// The [useSafeArea] argument is used to indicate if the dialog should only
/// display in 'safe' areas of the screen not used by the operating system
/// (see [SafeArea] for more details). It is `true` by default, which means
/// the dialog will not overlap operating system areas. If it is set to `false`
/// the dialog will only be constrained by the screen size. It can not be `null`.
///
/// The [useRootNavigator] argument is used to determine whether to push the
/// dialog to the [Navigator] furthest from or nearest to the given [context].
/// By default, [useRootNavigator] is `true` and the dialog route created by
/// this method is pushed to the root navigator. It can not be `null`.
///
/// The [routeSettings] argument is passed to [showGeneralDialog],
/// see [RouteSettings] for details.
///
/// If the application has multiple [Navigator] objects, it may be necessary to
/// call `Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop(result)` to close the
/// dialog rather than just `Navigator.pop(context, result)`.
///
/// Returns a [Future] that resolves to the value (if any) that was passed to
/// [Navigator.pop] when the dialog was closed.
///
/// ### State Restoration in Dialogs
///
/// Using this method will not enable state restoration for the dialog. In order
/// to enable state restoration for a dialog, use [Navigator.restorablePush]
/// or [Navigator.restorablePushNamed] with [DialogRoute].
///
/// For more information about state restoration, see [RestorationManager].
///
/// {@tool sample --template=freeform}
///
/// This sample demonstrates how to create a restorable Material dialog. This is
/// accomplished by enabling state restoration by specifying
/// [MaterialApp.restorationScopeId] and using [Navigator.restorablePush] to
/// push [DialogRoute] when the button is tapped.
