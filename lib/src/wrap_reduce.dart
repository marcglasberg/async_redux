/// You may globally wrap the reducer to allow for some pre or post-processing.
/// Note: if the action also have a [ReduxAction.wrapReduce] method, this global
/// wrapper will be called AFTER (it will wrap the action's wrapper which wraps
/// the action's reducer).
///
/// If [ifShouldProcess] is overridden to return `false`, the wrapper will
/// be turned of.
///
/// The [process] method gets the old-state and the new-state, and returns
/// the end state that you want to send to the store. Note: In sync reducers,
/// the old-state is the state before the reducer is called. However, in
/// async reducers, the old-state is the state AFTER the reducer returns
/// but before the reducer's result is committed to the store.
///
/// For example, this wrapper checks if `newState.someInfo` is out of range,
/// and if that's the case it's logged and changed to some valid value:
///
/// ```
/// class MyWrapReduce extends WrapReduce<AppState> {
///   St process({required St oldState, required St newState}) {
///     if (identical(newState.someInfo, oldState.someInfo) || oldState.someInfo.isWithRange())
///     return newState;
///     else {
///       Logger.log('Invalid value: ${oldState.someInfo}');
///       return newState.copy(someInfo: newState.someInfo.copy(SomeInfo(validValue)));
///       }}}
/// ```
///
/// Note the [wrapReduce] method encapsulates the complexities of
/// differentiating sync and async reducers. However, you can override it
/// to provide your own implementation if necessary.
///
