## 25.4.0

* Added `Store.disposeProp(key)` and `Action.disposeProp(key)` methods to 
  dispose and remove Futures/Timers/Streams that were previously set 
  using `setProp()`.
  See [Streams and Timers](https://asyncredux.com/flutter/miscellaneous/streams-and-timers/).

## 25.3.1

* In tests, you can now use `store.dispatchAndWaitAllActions`. It first
  dispatches an `action`, and then it waits until ALL current actions in
  progress finish dispatching. In other words, it helps make sure that the
  app state "settled" before you check the state.

  ```dart
  await store.dispatchAndWaitAllActions(MyAction());
  ```

* Some internal properties used by the provided mixins are now tied to the
  `Store` so that they reset when the store is recreated. This is useful to make
  sure tests are not affected by previous tests. For example, if you dispatch an
  action that has some throttle, then recreate the store for another test, you
  can dispatch the same action again without waiting for the throttle to expire.
  You can also manually delete all those properties by calling
  `store.internalMixinProps.clear()`.

* If you are running tests, you can change `store.forceInternetOnOffSimulation`
  to simulate the internet connection as ON or OFF for the provided mixins
  `CheckInternet`, `AbortWhenNoInternet`, and `UnlimitedRetryCheckInternet`:

  ```dart           
  // There is internet
  store.forceInternetOnOffSimulation = () => false;
  
  // There is no internet
  store.forceInternetOnOffSimulation = () => false;
  
  // Uses the real internet connection status (default).
  store.forceInternetOnOffSimulation = () => null;
  ```

## 25.1.1

* The `Throttle` action mixin now has an `ignoreThrottle` parameter, which
  allows you to ignore the throttle period for a specific action. This is useful
  when you want to bypass the throttle for certain actions, while still applying
  it to others. For example:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     final bool force;
     MyAction({this.force = false});  
     bool get ignoreThrottle => force; // Here!   
     ...
  }
  ```

* The `Throttle` action mixin now has a `removeLockOnError` parameter, which
  removes the lock when an error occurs. This is useful when you want to allow
  a failed action to run again within the throttle period. For example:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     bool removeLockOnError = true; // Here!
     ...
  }
  ```

* If your app uses Async Redux and your server
  uses [Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev/), you can add the Dart-only core
  package https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux_core to your server side.
  Now, if you throw a `UserException` in your backend code, that exception will
  automatically be thrown in the frontend. As long as the Serverpod cloud
  function is called inside an action, Async Redux will display the
  exception message to the user in a dialog (or other UI element that you can
  customize). Note: This can also be used
  with [package i18n_extension_core](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/i18n_extension_core)
  to make sure the error message gets translated to the user's language.
  For example: `UserException('The password you typed is invalid'.i18n);` in the
  backend, will reach the frontend already translated as
  `UserException('La contraseña que ingresaste no es válida')` if the user
  device is in Spanish.

  Setup: For all this to work in Serverpod, after you import `async_redux_core`
  in the `pubspec.yaml` file of the server project, you must add the
  `UserException` class to your `generator.yaml` file, in its `extraClasses`
  section:

  ```yaml  
  type: server
  ...
  
    extraClasses:
      - package:async_redux_core/async_redux_core.dart:UserException
  ```  

  Note: Async Redux also works with [Celest](https://celest.dev/) since 22.1.0.

## 25.0.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: The action's `wrapReduce` method now returns `FutureOr<St?>`
  instead of returning `FutureOr<St?> Function()`
  This breaking change is unlikely to affect you in any way, because the
  `wrapReduce` is an advanced feature mostly used to implement action mixins,
  like `Retry` and `Debounce`.


* You can now use the `Debounce` action mixin.
  Debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a certain period
  of inactivity. Each time the debounced function is called, the period of
  inactivity (or wait time) is reset.

  The function will only execute after it stops being called for the duration
  of the wait time. Debouncing is useful in situations where you want to
  ensure that a function is not called too frequently and only runs after
  some “quiet time.”

  For example, it’s commonly used for handling input validation in text fields,
  where you might not want to validate the input every time the user presses
  a key, but rather after they've stopped typing for a certain amount of time.

  The `debounce` value is given in milliseconds, and the default is 333
  milliseconds (1/3 of a second). You can override this default:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
     final int debounce = 1000; // Here!
     ...
  }
  ```

  ### Advanced debounce usage

  The debounce is, by default, based on the action `runtimeType`. This means
  it will reset the debounce period when another action of the same
  runtimeType was is dispatched within the debounce period. In other words,
  the runtimeType is the "lock". If you want to debounce based on a different
  lock, you can override the `lockBuilder` method. For example, here
  we debounce two different actions based on the same lock:

  ```dart
  class MyAction1 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
     Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
     ...
  }
  
  class MyAction2 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
     Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
     ...
  }
  ```

  Another example is to debounce based on some field of the action:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Debounce {
     final String lock;
     MyAction(this.lock);
     Object? lockBuilder() => lock;
     ...
  }
  ```

  See
  the [Documentation](https://asyncredux.com/flutter/advanced-actions/action-mixins#debounce).


* You can now use the `Throttle` action mixin.
  Throttling ensures the action will be dispatched at most once in the
  specified throttle period. In other words, it prevents the action from
  running too frequently.

  If an action is dispatched multiple times within a throttle period, it will
  only execute the first time, and the others will be aborted. After the
  throttle period has passed, the action will be allowed to execute again,
  which will reset the throttle period.

  If you use the action to load information, the throttle period may be
  considered as the time the loaded information is "fresh". After the
  throttle period, the information is considered "stale" and the action will
  be allowed to load the information again.

  For example, if you are using a `StatefulWidget` that needs to load some
  information, you can dispatch the loading action when widget is created,
  and specify a throttle period so that it doesn't load the information again
  too often.

  If you are using a `StoreConnector`, you can use the `onInit` parameter:

  ```dart
  class MyScreenConnector extends StatelessWidget {
    Widget build(BuildContext context) => StoreConnector<AppState, _Vm>(
      vm: () => _Factory(),
      onInit: _onInit, // Here!
      builder: (context, vm) {
        return MyScreenConnector(
          information: vm.information,
          ...
        ),
      );
  
    void _onInit(Store<AppState> store) {
      store.dispatch(LoadAction());
    }
  }
  ```

  and then:

  ```dart
  class LoadAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
  
    final int throttle = 5000;
  
    Future<AppState?> reduce() async {
      var information = await loadInformation();
      return state.copy(information: information);
    }
  }
  ```

  The `throttle` is given in milliseconds, and the default is 1000
  milliseconds (1 second). You can override this default:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     final int throttle = 500; // Here!
     ...
  }
  ```

  ### Advanced throttle usage

  The throttle is, by default, based on the action `runtimeType`. This means
  it will throttle an action if another action of the same runtimeType was
  previously dispatched within the throttle period. In other words, the
  runtimeType is the "lock". If you want to throttle based on a different
  lock, you can override the `lockBuilder` method. For example, here
  we throttle two different actions based on the same lock:

  ```dart
  class MyAction1 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
     ...
  }
  
  class MyAction2 extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     Object? lockBuilder() => 'myLock';
     ...
  }
  ```

  Another example is to throttle based on some field of the action:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Throttle {
     final String lock;
     MyAction(this.lock);
     Object? lockBuilder() => lock;
     ...
  }
  ```   

  See
  the [Documentation](https://asyncredux.com/flutter/advanced-actions/action-mixins#throttle).

## 24.0.7

* Added some missing params to `MockStore` constructor.

## 24.0.6

* Fixed translation typo bug.

## 24.0.2

* `LocalPersist` and `LocalJsonPersist` now allow you to define the base
  directory by
  setting the `useBaseDirectory` static field. The default is, as before, the
  application's documents directory. Other options are the cache directory
  (`LocalPersist.useAppCacheDir`), the downloads directory
  (`LocalPersist.useAppDownloadsDir`), or any other custom directory
  (`LocalPersist.useCustomBaseDirectory`).

## 23.2.0

* You can now use the `UnlimitedRetryCheckInternet` to check if there is
  internet when you
  run some action that needs it. If there is no internet, the action will abort
  silently
  and then retried unlimited times, until there is internet. It will also retry
  if there
  is internet but the action failed.


* You can provide a `CloudSync` object to the store constructor. It's similar to
  the `Persistor`, but can be used to synchronize the state of the application
  with the server. This is experimental.


* Fixed `isWaiting()` for checking multiple actions and when state doesn't
  change.

## 23.1.1

* New: Async Redux website at https://asyncredux.com

* New: [Async Redux for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-redux-react)

## 23.0.2

* Fixed `isWaiting()` when action fails.

## 23.0.1

* Fixed `disposeProps`.

## 23.0.0

* Now using `connectivity_plus: 6.0.3` or up.

## 22.5.0

* You can now use `dispatchAll()` and `dispatchAndWaitAll()` to dispatch
  multiple actions
  in parallel. For example:

  ```dart   
  class BuyAndSell extends Action {
    Future<AppState> reduce() async {
       
      await dispatchAndWaitAll([
        BuyAction('IBM'), 
        SellAction('TSLA')
      ]);
  
      return state.copy(message: 'New cash balance is ${state.cash}');
    }
  }
  ```  

## 22.4.9

* For those who use `flutter_hooks`, you can now use the
  new https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks_async_redux package
  to add Redux to flutter_hooks.

## 22.3.0

* In the `reduce` method of your actions you can now access the _initial state_
  of the action, by using the `initialState` getter. In other words, you have
  access to a copy of the state as it was when the action was first dispatched.
  This is useful when you need to calculate some value asynchronously, and then
  you only want to apply the result to the state if that value hasn't changed in
  the meantime. For example:

  ```dart
  class MyAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> {
    Future<AppState> reduce() async {
      var newValue = await someAsyncStuff();
      if (state.value == initialState.value) return state.copyWith(value: newValue);
      else return null;
    }
  }
  ```   

## 22.1.0

* You can now use `var isWaiting = context.isWaiting(MyAction)` to check if an
  async action of the given type is currently being processed. You can then use
  this
  boolean to show a loading spinner in your widget.
  Note: Inside your `VmFactory` you can also use
  `isWaiting: isWaiting(MyAction)`. See
  the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_show_spinner.dart">
  Show Spinner Example</a>.


* You can now use `var isFailed = context.isFailed(MyAction)` to check if an
  action of the given type has thrown an `UserException`. You can then use this
  boolean to show an error message.
  You can also get the exception with
  `var exception = context.exceptionFor(MyAction)` to
  use its error message, and clear the exception with
  `context.clearExceptionFor(MyAction)`.
  Note: Inside your `VmFactory` you can also use `isFailed: isFailed(MyAction)`
  etc. See
  the <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_show_error_dialog.dart">
  Show Error Dialog Example</a>.


* You can add **mixins** to your actions, to accomplish common tasks:

    - `CheckInternet` ensures actions only run with internet, otherwise an error
      dialog
      prompts users to check their connection:

      ```dart
      class LoadText extends ReduxAction<AppState> with CheckInternet {
          
      Future<String> reduce() async {
          var response = await http.get('http://numbersapi.com/42');
          ...      
      }}
      ```

    - `NoDialog` can be added to `CheckInternet` so that no dialog is opened.
      Instead, you can display some information in your widgets:

      ```dart
      class LoadText extends Action with CheckInternet, NoDialog { ... }
      
      if (context.isFailed(LoadText)) Text('No Internet connection');
      ```

    - `AbortWhenNoInternet` aborts the action silently (without showing any
      dialogs)
      if there is no internet connection.

    - `NonReentrant` prevents reentrant actions, so that when you dispatch an
      action
      that's already running it gets aborted (no errors are shown).

    - `Retry` retries the action a few times with exponential backoff, if it
      fails.
      Add `UnlimitedRetries` to retry the action indefinitely:

      ```dart
      class LoadText extends ReduxAction<AppState> with Retry, UnlimitedRetries, NonReentrant { 
      ```

  Other mixins will be provided in the future, for Throttling, Debouncing and
  Caching.


* Some features of the `async_redux` package are now available in a standalone
  Dart-only core package: https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux_core. You may use
  that core package when you are developing a Dart server (backend)
  with [Celest](https://celest.dev/), or when developing your own Dart-only
  package that does not depend on Flutter.
  Note: For the moment, the core package simply contains the `UserException`,
  and nothing else.
  If you now import `async_redux_core` in your Celest server code and throw an
  `UserException` there, the exception message will automatically be shown in a
  dialog to the user in your client app (if you use the `UserExceptionDialog`
  feature).

  > **For Flutter applications nothing changes.**
  > You don't need to import the core package directly.
  > You should continue to use this async_redux package, which already exports
  > the code that's now in the core package.

* You can now access the store inside of widgets, and have your widgets rebuild
  when the state changes, by using `context.state` and `context.dispatch` etc.
  This is only useful when you want to access the store state, and dispatch
  actions directly inside your widgets, instead of using the `StoreConnector` (
  dumb widget / smart widget pattern). For example:

  ```dart
  // Read state (will rebuild when the state changes) 
  var myInfo = context.state.myInfo;
  
  // Dispatch action
  context.dispatch(MyAction());
  
  // Use isWaiting to show a spinner
  if (context.isWaiting(MyAction)) return CircularProgressIndicator();
  
  // Use isFailed to show an error message
  if (context.isFailed(MyAction)) return Text('Loading failed');
                                                                   
  // Use exceptionFor to get the error message from the exception
  if (context.isFailed(MyAction)) return Text(context.exceptionFor(MyAction).message);
  
  // Use clearExceptionFor to clear the error
  context.clearExceptionFor(MyAction);
  ```      

  However, to use `context.state` like shown above you must define this
  extension method in your own code (supposing your state class is called
  `AppState`):

  ```dart  
  extension BuildContextExtension on BuildContext {
     AppState get state => getState<AppState>();       
  }
  ```     

  See
  the: <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/example/lib/main_conector_vs_provider.dart.dart">
  Connector vs Provider Example</a>.


* You can now get and set properties in the `Store` using the `prop` and
  `setProp` methods.
  These methods are available in `Store`, in `ReduxAction`, and in `VmFactory`.
  They can be used to save global values, but scoped to the store.
  For example, you could save timers, streams or futures used by actions:

  ```dart  
  setProp("timer", Timer(Duration(seconds: 1), () => print("tick")));
  var timer = prop<Timer>("timer");
  timer.cancel();
  ```   

  You can later use `store.disposeProps` to stop, close or ignore, all stream
  related objects, timers and futures, saved as props in the store. It will also
  remove them from there.

## 22.0.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: `StoreConnector.model` was removed, after being deprecated
  for a long time. Please, use the `vm` parameter instead. See classes
  `VmFactory` and `Vm`.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `ReduxAction.reduceWithState()` was removed, after being
  deprecated for a long time.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `StoreProvider.of` was removed. See `context.state` and
  `context.dispatch` etc, in version 22.1.0 above.

* BREAKING CHANGE: The `UserException` class was modified so that it was
  possible to move it to the `async_redux_core`. If your use of `UserException`
  was limited to specifying the error message, then you don't need to change
  anything:
  `throw UserException('Error message')` will continue to work as before.
  However, for other more advanced features you will have to read the
  `UserException`
  documentation and adapt. In the new public API of `UserException` you can now
  specify a `message`, `reason`, `code`, `errorText` and `ifOpenDialog` in the
  constructor, and then you can use methods `addCallbacks`, `addCause`,
  `addProps`,
  `withErrorText` and `noDialog` to add more information:

  ```dart
  throw UserException('Invalid number', reason: 'Must be less than 42')
     .addCallbacks(onOk: () => print('OK'), onCancel: () => print('CANCEL'))
     .addCause(FormatException('Invalid input'))
     .addProps({'number': 42}))                                                  
     .withErrorText('Type a smaller number')
     .noDialog;
  ```                  

  Note the `code` parameter can only be a number now. If you were using a
  different type,
  for example enums, you can now include it in the props, like
  so: `throw UserException('').addProps({'code': myError.invalidInput}).` or you
  can even
  create an extension method which allows you to
  write `throw UserException('').withCode(myError.invalidInput).`
  However, please read the new `UserException` documentation to learn about the
  recommended way to use `code` to define the text of the error messages, and
  even easily
  translate them to the user language by using
  the [i18n_extension](https://pub.dev/packages/i18n_extension) translations
  package.

* To test the view-model generated by a `VmFactory`, you can now use the static
  method `Vm.createFrom(store, factory)`. The method will return the view-model,
  which you
  can use to inspect the view-model properties directly, or call any of the
  view-model
  callbacks. Example:

  ```dart
  var store = Store(initialState: User("Mary"));
  var vm = Vm.createFrom(store, MyFactory());
  
  // Checking a view-model property.    
  expect(vm.user.name, "Mary");
  
  // Calling a view-model callback and waiting for the action to finish.  
  vm.onChangeNameTo("Bill"); // Dispatches SetNameAction("Bill").
  await store.waitActionType(SetNameAction);
  expect(store.state.name, "Bill");    
  
  // Calling a view-model callback and waiting for the state to change.
  vm.onChangeNameTo("Bill"); // Dispatches SetNameAction("Bill").
  await store.waitCondition((state) => state.name == "Bill");
  expect(store.state.name, "Bill");
  ```

* DEPRECATION WARNING: While the `StoreTester` is a powerful tool with advanced
  features
  that are beneficial for the most complex testing scenarios, for **almost all
  tests**
  it's now recommended to use the `Store` directly. This approach involves
  waiting for an
  action to complete its dispatch process or for the store state to meet a
  certain
  condition. After this, you can verify the current state or action using the
  new
  methods `store.dispatchAndWait`, `store.waitCondition`,
  `store.waitActionCondition`,
  `store.waitAllActions`, `store.waitActionType`, `store.waitAllActionTypes`,
  and `store.waitAnyActionTypeFinishes`. For example:

  ```dart
  // Wait for some action to dispatch and check the state. 
  await store.dispatchAndWait(MyAction());
  expect(store.state.name, 'John')
  
  // Wait for some action to dispatch, and check for errors in the action status.
  var status = await dispatchAndWait(MyAction());
  expect(status.originalError, isA<UserException>());
  
  // Dispatches two actions in SERIES (one after the other).
  await dispatchAndWait(SomeAsyncAction());
  await dispatchAndWait(AnotherAsyncAction());
  
  // Dispatches two actions in PARALLEL and wait for their TYPES.
  expect(store.state.portfolio, ['TSLA']);
  dispatch(BuyAction('IBM'));
  dispatch(SellAction('TSLA'));
  await store.waitAllActionTypes([BuyAction, SellAction]);
  expect(store.state.portfolio, ['IBM']);
  
  // Dispatches two actions in PARALLEL and wait for them.
  let action1 = BuyAction('IBM');
  let action2 = BuyAction('TSLA');
  dispatch(action1);
  dispatch(action2);
  await store.waitAllActions([action1, action2]);
  expect(store.state.portfolio.containsAll('IBM', 'TSLA'), isFalse);
  
  // Wait until no actions are in progress.
  dispatch(BuyStock('IBM'));
  dispatch(BuyStock('TSLA'));  
  await waitAllActions([]);                 
  expect(state.stocks, ['IBM', 'TSLA']);
  
  // Wait for some action of a given type.
  dispatch(ChangeNameAction());
  var action = store.waitActionType(ChangeNameAction);
  expect(action, isA<ChangeNameAction>());
  expect(action.status.isCompleteOk, isTrue);
  expect(store.state.name, 'Bill');
  
  // Wait until any action of the given types finishes dispatching.
  dispatch(BuyOrSellAction());   
  var action = store.waitAnyActionTypeFinishes([BuyAction, SellAction]);  
  expect(store.state.portfolio.contains('IBM'), isTrue);
  
  // Wait for some state condition.
  expect(store.state.name, 'John')               
  dispatch(ChangeNameAction("Bill"));
  var action = await store.waitCondition((state) => state.name == "Bill");
  expect(action, isA<ChangeNameAction>());
  expect(store.state.name, 'Bill');  
  ```                          

  Note the `StoreTester` will NOT be removed, now or in the future. It's just
  not the
  recommended
  way to test the store anymore.

## 21.7.1

* DEPRECATION WARNING:
    - Replace `action.isFinished` with `action.status.isCompletedOk`
    - Replace `action.status.isBeforeDone` with
      `action.status.hasFinishedMethodBefore`
    - Replace `action.status.isReduceDone` with
      `action.status.hasFinishedMethodReduce`
    - Replace `action.status.isAfterDone` with
      `action.status.hasFinishedMethodAfter`
    - Replace `action.status.isFinished` with `action.status.isCompletedOk`


* The `action.status` now has a few more values:
    - `isCompleted` if the action has completed executing, either with or
      without errors.
    - `isCompletedOk` if the action has completed with no errors.
    - `isCompletedFailed` if the action has completed with errors.
    - `originalError` Holds the error thrown by the action's before/reduce
      methods, if
      any.
    - `wrappedError` Holds the error thrown by the action, after it was
      processed by the
      action's `wrapError` and the `globalWrapError`.

## 21.6.0

* DEPRECATION WARNING: The `wrapError` parameter of the `Store` constructor is
  now
  deprecated in
  favor of the `globalWrapError` parameter. The reason for this deprecation is
  that the
  new `GlobalWrapError` works in the same way as the action's
  `ReduxAction.wrapError`,
  while `WrapError` does not. The difference is that when `WrapError` returns
  `null`, the
  original
  error is not modified, while with `GlobalWrapError` returning `null` will
  instead
  disable the
  error. In other words, where your old `WrapError` returned `null`, your new
  `GlobalWrapError`
  should return the original `error`:

  ```
  // WrapError (deprecated):
  Object? wrap(error, stackTrace, action) {
     if (error is MyException) return null; // Keep the error unaltered.
     else return processError(error);
  }
  
  // GlobalWrapError:
  Object? wrap( error, stackTrace, action) {
     if (error is MyException) return error; // Keep the error unaltered.
     else return processError(error);
  }
  ```
  Also note, `GlobalWrapError` is more powerful because it can disable the
  error,
  whereas `WrapError` cannot.

* Throwing an error in the action's `wrapError` or in the `GlobalWrapError` was
  disallowed
  (you needed to make sure it never happened). Now, it's allowed. If instead of
  RETURNING
  an error
  you THROW an error inside these wrappers, AsyncRedux will catch it and use it
  instead
  the original
  error. In other words, returning an error or throwing an error from inside the
  wrappers
  now has
  the same effect. However, it is still recommended to return the error rather
  than
  throwing it.

## 21.5.0

* DEPRECATION WARNING: Method `dispatchAsync` was renamed to `dispatchAndWait`.
  The old
  name is
  still available, but deprecated and will be removed. The new name is more
  descriptive of
  what the
  method does, and the fact that `dispatchAndWait` can be used to dispatch both
  sync and
  async
  actions. The only difference between `dispatchAndWait` and `dispatch` is that
  `dispatchAndWait`
  returns a `Future` which can be awaited to know when the action is finished.

## 21.1.1

* `await StoreTester.dispatchAndWait(action)` dispatches an action, and then
  waits until
  it
  finishes. This is the same as
  doing: `storeTester.dispatch(action); await storeTester.wait(action);`.

## 21.0.2

* Flutter 3.16.0 compatible.

## 20.0.2

* Fixed `WrapReduce` (which may be used to wrap the reducer to allow for some
  pre- or
  post-processing) to avoid async reducers to be called twice.

## 20.0.0

* Flutter 3.10.0 and Dart 3.0.0

## 19.0.2

* Docs improvement.

## 19.0.1

* Flutter 3.7.5, Dart 2.19.2, fast_immutable_collections: 9.0.0.

* BREAKING CHANGE: The `Action.wrapError(error, stackTrace)` method now also
  gets the
  stacktrace
  instead of just the error. If your code breaks, just add the extra parameter,
  like so:
  `Object wrapError(error) => ...` turns into
  `Object wrapError(error, _) => ...`

<br>

* BREAKING CHANGE: When a `Persistor` is provided to the Store, it now considers
  the
  `initialState` is already persisted. Before this change, it considered nothing
  was
  persisted. Note: Before you create the store, you are allowed to call the
  `Persistor`
  methods
  directly: `Persistor.saveInitialState()`, `readState()` and `deleteState()`.
  However, after you create the store, please don't call those methods yourself
  anymore.
  If you do it, AsyncRedux cannot keep track of which state was persisted. After
  store
  creation,
  if necessary, you should use the corresponding methods
  `Store.saveInitialStateInPersistence()`,
  `Store.readStateFromPersistence()` and `Store.deleteStateFromPersistence()`.
  These
  methods let
  AsyncRedux keep track of the persisted state, so that it's able to call
  `Persistor.persistDifference()` with the appropriate parameters.

<br>

* Method `Store.getLastPersistedStateFromPersistor()` returns the state that was
  last persisted to the local persistence. It's unlikely you will use this
  method yourself.

<br>

* BREAKING CHANGE: The factory declaration used to have two type parameters, but
  now it
  has three:
  `class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, MyConnector, MyViewModel>`
  With that change, you can now reference the view-model inside the Factory
  methods, by
  using
  the `vm` getter. Example:
    ```
    ViewModel fromStore() =>
      ViewModel(
        value: _calculateValue(),
        onTap: _onTap);
    }  
    
    void _onTap() => dispatch(SaveValueAction(vm.value)); // Use the value from the vm.
    ```

  Note 1: You can only use the `vm` getter after the `fromStore()` method is
  called, which
  means
  you cannot reference the `vm` inside of the `fromStore()` method itself. If
  you do that,
  you'll get a `StoreException`. You also cannot use the `vm` getter if the
  view-model is
  null.

  Note 2: To reduce boilerplate, and not having to pass the `AppState` type
  parameter
  whenever you
  create a Factory, I recommend you define a base Factory, like so:
    ```
    abstract class BaseFactory<T extends Widget?, Model extends Vm> extends VmFactory<AppState, T, Model> {
        BaseFactory([T? connector]) : super(connector);
    }
    ```

* Added class LocalJsonPersist to help persist the state as pure Json.

## 18.0.2

* Fixed small bug when persistor is paused before being used once.

## 18.0.0

* Version bump of dependencies.

## 17.0.1

* Fixed issue with the StoreConnector.shouldUpdateModel method when the widget
  updates.

## 17.0.0

* The `StateObserver.observe()` method signature changed to include an `error`
  parameter:
  ```
  void observe(
     ReduxAction<St> action,
     St stateIni,
     St stateEnd,
     Object? error,
     int dispatchCount,
     );
  ```

  The state-observers are now also called when the action reducer complete with
  a error.
  In this case, the `error` object will not be null. This makes it easier to use
  state-observers
  for metrics. Please, see the documentation for the recommended clean-code way
  to do
  this.

## 16.1.0

* Added another cache function, for 2 states and 3 parameters:
  `cache2states_3params`.

## 16.0.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Async `reduce()` methods (those that return Futures) are now
  called
  synchronously (in the same microtask of their dispatch), just like a regular
  async
  function is.
  In other words, now dispatching a sync action works just the same as calling a
  sync
  function,
  and dispatching an async action works just the same as calling an async
  function.

  ```
  // Example: The below code will print: "BEFORE a1 f1 AFTER a2 f2"  
  
  print('BEFORE');
  dispatch(MyAsyncAction());
  asyncFunction();
  print('AFTER');     
          
  class MyAsyncAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> {
     Future<AppState?> reduce() async {
        print('a1');
        await microtask;
        print('a2');
        return state;
        }  
  }
  
  Future<void> asyncFunction() async {
     print('f1');
     await Future.microtask((){});
     print('f2');     
     } 

  ```  

  Before version `16.0.0`, the `reduce()` method was called in a later
  microtask. Please
  note, the
  async `reduce()` methods continue to return and apply the state in a later
  microtask (
  this did
  not change).

  The above breaking change is unlikely to affect you in any way, but if you
  want the old behavior, just add `await microtask;` to the first line of your
  `reduce()` method.

<br>

* BREAKING CHANGE: When your reducer is async (i.e., returns `Future<AppState>`)
  you must
  make sure
  you **do not return a completed future**, meaning all execution paths of the
  reducer
  must pass
  through at least one `await` keyword. In other words, don't return a Future if
  you don't
  need it.
  If your reducer has no `await`s, you must return `AppState?` instead of
  `Future<AppState?>`, or
  add `await microtask;` to the start of your reducer, or return `null`. For
  example:

  ```dart 
  // These are right:
  AppState? reduce() { return state; }
  AppState? reduce() { someFunc(); return state; }
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { await someFuture(); return state; }
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { await microtask; return state; }
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { if (state.someBool) return await calculation(); return null; }
  
  // But these are wrong:
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { return state; }
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { someFunc(); return state; }
  Future<AppState?> reduce() async { if (state.someBool) return await calculation(); return state; }
  ```

  If you don't follow this rule, AsyncRedux may seem to work ok, but will
  eventually
  misbehave.

  It's generally easy to make sure you are not returning a completed future.
  In the rare case your reducer function is very complex, and you are unsure
  that all code
  paths
  pass through an `await`, just add `assertUncompletedFuture();` at the very END
  of your
  `reduce`
  method, right before the `return`. If you do that, an error will be shown in
  the console
  if
  the `reduce` method ever returns a completed future.

  If you're an advanced user interested in the details, check the
  <a href="https://github.com/marcglasberg/async_redux/blob/master/test/sync_async_test.dart">
  sync/async tests</a>.

<br>

* When the `Event` class was created, Flutter did not have another class with
  that name.
  Now there is. For this reason, a typedef now allows you to use `Evt` instead.
  If you need, you can hide one of them, by importing AsyncRedux like this:

  ```dart
  import 'package:async_redux/async_redux.dart' hide Event;
  ```
  or

  ```dart
  import 'package:async_redux/async_redux.dart' hide Evt;  
  ```

## 15.0.0

* Flutter 3.0 support.

## 14.1.4

* `NavigateAction.popUntilRouteName()` can print the routes (for debugging).

## 14.1.2

* Better stacktrace for wrapped errors in actions.

## 14.1.1

* The store persistor can now be paused and resumed, with methods
  `store.pausePersistor()`,
  `store.persistAndPausePersistor()` and `store.resumePersistor()`. This may be
  used
  together with
  the app lifecycle, to prevent a persistence process to start when the app is
  being shut
  down. For
  example:

  ```     
  child: StoreProvider<AppState>(
  store: store,
    child: AppLifecycleManager( // Add this widget here to capture lifecycle events.
      child: MaterialApp( 
  ...     
  
  class AppLifecycleManager extends StatefulWidget {
    final Widget child;
    const AppLifecycleManager({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);  
    _AppLifecycleManagerState createState() => _AppLifecycleManagerState();
  }
  
  class _AppLifecycleManagerState extends State<AppLifecycleManager> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }
  
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState lifecycle) {
    store.dispatch(ProcessLifecycleChange_Action(lifecycle));
  }
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => widget.child;
  }

  class ProcessLifecycleChangeAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> {
     final AppLifecycleState lifecycle;
     ProcessLifecycleChangeAction(this.lifecycle);

     Future<AppState?> reduce() async {
       if (lifecycle == AppLifecycleState.resumed || lifecycle == AppLifecycleState.inactive) {
         store.resumePersistor();  
       } else if (lifecycle == AppLifecycleState.paused || lifecycle == AppLifecycleState.detached) {
         store.persistAndPausePersistor();
       } else
         throw AssertionError(lifecycle);

       return null;
     }
   }
  ```  

* When logging out of the app, you can call `store.deletePersistedState()` to
  ask the
  persistor to
  delete the state from disk.

* BREAKING CHANGE: This is a very minor change, unlikely to affect you. The
  signature for
  the `Action.wrapError` method has changed from `Object? wrapError(error)`
  to `Object? wrapError(Object error)`. If you get an error when you upgrade,
  you can fix
  it by
  changing the method that broke into `Object? wrapError(dynamic error)`.

* BREAKING CHANGE: Context is now nullable for these StoreConnector methods:
  ```
  void onInitialBuildCallback(BuildContext? context, Store<St> store, Model viewModel);
  void onDidChangeCallback(BuildContext? context, Store<St> store, Model viewModel);
  void onWillChangeCallback(BuildContext? context, Store<St> store, Model previousVm, Model newVm);
  ```   

## 13.3.1

* Version bump of dependencies.

## 13.2.2

* Version bump of dependencies.

## 13.2.1

* Fixed `MockStore.dispatchAsync()` and `MockStore.dispatchSync()` methods.
  Note: `dispatchAsync` was later renamed to `dispatchAndWait`.

## 13.2.0

* `delay` parameter for `WaitAction.add()` and `WaitAction.remove()` methods.

## 13.1.0

* Added missing `dispatchSync` and `dispatchAsync` to `StoreTester`.
  Note: `dispatchAsync` was later renamed to `dispatchAndWait`.

## 13.0.6

* Added missing `dispatchSync` to `VmFactory`.

## 13.0.5

* Sometimes, the store state is such that it's not possible to create a
  view-model. In
  those cases,
  the `fromStore()` method in the `Factory` can now return a `null` view-model.
  In that
  case,
  the `builder()` method in the `StoreConnector` can detect that the view-model
  is `null`,
  and then
  return some widget that does not depend on the view-model. For example:

  ```
  return StoreConnector<AppState, ViewModel?>(
    vm: () => Factory(this),
    builder: (BuildContext context, ViewModel? vm) {
      return (vm == null)
        ? Text("The user is not logged in")
        : MyHomePage(user: vm.user)
  
  ...              
         
  class Factory extends VmFactory<AppState, MyHomePageConnector, ViewModel> {   
  ViewModel? fromStore() {
    return (store.state.user == null)
        ? null
        : ViewModel(user: store.state.user)
  
  ...
  
  class ViewModel extends Vm {
    final User user;  
    ViewModel({required this.user}) : super(equals: [user]);
  ```

## 13.0.4

* `dispatch` can be used to dispatch both sync and async actions. It returns a
  `FutureOr`.
  You can
  await the result or not, as desired.

* `dispatchAsync` can also be used to dispatch both sync and async actions. But
  it always
  returns a
  `Future` (not a `FutureOr`). Use this only when you explicitly need a
  `Future`, for
  example, when
  working with the `RefreshIndicator` widget. Note: `dispatchAsync` was later
  renamed
  to `dispatchAndWait`.

* `dispatchSync` allows you to dispatch SYNC actions only. In that case,
  `dispatchSync(action)` is
  exactly the same as `dispatch(action)`. However, if your action is ASYNC,
  `dispatchSync`
  will
  throw an error. Use this only when you need to make sure an action is sync (
  meaning it
  impacts the
  store state immediately when it returns). This is not very common. Important:
  An action
  is sync if
  and only if both its `before` and `reduce` methods are sync. If any or both
  these
  methods return a
  Future, then the action is async and will throw an error when used with
  `dispatchSync`.

* `StoreTester.getConnectorTester` helps test `StoreConnector`s methods, such as
  `onInit`,
  `onDispose` and `onWillChange`. For example, suppose you have a
  `StoreConnector` which
  dispatches `SomeAction` on its `onInit`. You could test it like this:

  ``` 
  class MyConnector extends StatelessWidget { 
     Widget build(BuildContext context) => StoreConnector<AppState, Vm>(
        vm: () => _Factory(), 
        onInit: _onInit, 
        builder: (context, vm) { ... } 
     } 
  
  void _onInit(Store<AppState> store) => store.dispatch(SomeAction()); 
  } 
  
  var storeTester = StoreTester(...); 
  var connectorTester = storeTester.getConnectorTester(MyConnector()); 
  connectorTester.runOnInit(); 
  var info = await tester.waitUntil(SomeAction);  
  ```
  For more information, see section **Testing the StoreConnector** in the
  README.md file.

* Fix: `UserExceptionDialog` now shows all `UserException`s. It was discarding
  some of
  them under
  some circumstances, in a regression created in version 4.0.4.

* In the `Store` constructor you can now set `maxErrorsQueued` to control the
  maximum
  number of
  errors the `UserExceptionDialog` error-queue can hold. Default is `10`.

* `ConsoleActionObserver` is now provided to print action details to the
  console.

* `WaitAction.toString()` now returns a better description.

## 12.0.4

* `NavigateAction.toString()` now returns a better description, like
  `Action NavigateAction.pop()`.

* Fixed `NavigateAction.popUntilRouteName` and
  `NavigateAction.pushNamedAndRemoveAll` to
  return the
  correct `.type`.

* Added section `Dependency Injection` in README.md.

## 12.0.3

* Improved error messages when the reducer returns an invalid type.

* New `StoreTester` methods: `waitUntilAll()` and `waitUntilAllGetLast()`.

* Passing an environment to the store, to help with dependency injection:
  `Store(environment: ...)`

## 12.0.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: Improved state typing for some `Store` parameters. You will
  now have to
  use
  `Persistor<AppState>` instead of `Persistor`, and `WrapError<AppState>`
  instead of
  `WrapError`
  etc.

* Global `Store(wrapReduce: ...)`. You may now globally wrap the reducer to
  allow for some
  pre or
  post-processing. Note: if the action also have a wrapReduce method, this
  global wrapper
  will be
  called AFTER (it will wrap the action's wrapper which wraps the action's
  reducer).

* Downgraded dev_dependencies `test: ^1.16.0`

## 11.0.1

* You can now provide callbacks `onOk` and `onCancel` to an `UserException`.
  This allows
  you to
  dispatch actions when the user dismisses the error dialog. When using the
  default `UserExceptionDialog`: (i) if only `onOk` is provided, it will be
  called when
  the dialog
  is dismissed, no matter how. (ii) If both `onOk` and `onCancel` are provided,
  then
  `onOk` will be
  called only when the OK button is pressed, while `onCancel` will be called
  when the
  dialog is
  dismissed by any other means.

## 11.0.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: The `dispatchFuture` function is not necessary anymore. Just
  rename it
  to `dispatch`, since now the `dispatch` function always returns a future, and
  you can
  await it or
  not, as desired.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `ReduxAction.hasFinished()` has been deprecated. It should be
  renamed
  to `isFinished`.

* The `dispatch` function now returns an `ActionStatus`. Usually you will
  discard this
  info, but you
  may use it to know if the action completed with no errors. For example,
  suppose a
  `SaveAction`
  looks like this:

  ```                                      
  class SaveAction extends ReduxAction<AppState> {      
    Future<AppState> reduce() async {
	  bool isSaved = await saveMyInfo(); 
      if (!isSaved) throw UserException("Save failed.");	 
	  ...
    }
  }
  ```

  Then, when you save some info, you want to leave the current screen if and
  only if the
  save
  process succeeded:

  ```
  var status = await dispatch(SaveAction(info));
  if (status.isFinished) dispatch(NavigateAction.pop()); // Or: Navigator.pop(context) 
  ```              

## 10.0.1

* BREAKING CHANGE: The new `UserExceptionDialog.useLocalContext` parameter now
  allows
  the `UserExceptionDialog` to be put in the `builder` parameter of the
  `MaterialApp`
  widget. Even
  if you use this dialog, it is unlikely this will be a breaking change for you.
  But if it
  is, and
  your error dialog now has problems, simply make `useLocalContext: true` to
  return to the
  old
  behavior.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `StoreConnector` parameters `onInitialBuild`, `onDidChange`
  and `onWillChange` now also get the context and the store. For example, where
  you
  previously
  had `onInitialBuild(vm) {...}` now you have
  `onInitialBuild(context, store, vm) {...}`.

## 9.0.9

* LocalPersist `saveJson()` and `loadJson()` methods.

## 9.0.8

* FIC and weak-map version bump.

## 9.0.7

* NNBD improvements.
* FIC version bump.

## 9.0.1

* Downgrade to file: ^6.0.0 to improve compatibility.

## 9.0.0

* Nullsafe.

## 8.0.0

* Uses nullsafe dependencies (it's not yet itself nullsafe).

* BREAKING CHANGE: Cache functions (for memoization) have been renamed and
  extended.

## 7.0.2

* LocalPersist: Better handling of mock file-systems.

## 7.0.1

* BREAKING CHANGE:

  Now the `vm` parameter in the `StoreConnector` is a function that creates a
  `VmFactory` (instead
  of being a `VmFactory` object itself).

  So, to upgrade, you just need to provide this:

  ```
  vm: () => MyFactory(this),
  ```

  Instead of this:

  ```                
  // Deprecated.
  vm: MyFactory(this), 
  ```

  Now the `StoreConnector` will create a `VmFactory` every time it needs a
  view-model. The
  Factory
  will have access to:

    1) `state` getter: The state the store was holding when the factory and the
       view-model
       were
       created. This state is final inside the factory.

    2) `currentState()` method: The current (most recent) store state. This will
       return
       the current
       state the store holds at the time the method is called.

* New store parameter `immutableCollectionEquality` lets you override the
  equality used
  for
  immutable collections from
  the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections">
  fast_immutable_collections</a> package.

## 6.0.3

* StoreTester.dispatchState().

## 6.0.2

* VmFactory.getAndRemoveFirstError().

## 6.0.1

* `NavigateAction` now closely follows the `Navigator` api:  `push()`,
  `pop()`, `popAndPushNamed()`, `pushNamed()`, `pushReplacement()`,
  `pushAndRemoveUntil()`,
  `replace()`, `replaceRouteBelow()`, `pushReplacementNamed()`,
  `pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()`,
  `pushNamedAndRemoveAll()`, `popUntil()`, `removeRoute()`,
  `removeRouteBelow()`,
  `popUntilRouteName()` and `popUntilRoute()`.

## 1.0.0

* Initial commit: 2019/Aug05
